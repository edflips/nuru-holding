# Nuru holding page

> This is actually a single page site, but, heyho!

## development

Based on the [static-site-boilerplate](https://opencollective.com/static-site-boilerplate) project.

Look at the package.json file for all of the scripts. The main ones you'll need though are:

```bash
## pull the project
git clone https://github.com/PUncle/nuru-holding.git

## cd into the project directory
cd nuru-holding

## run development environment - available at http://localhost:8000
npm start

## build for production
npm run build
 ```

Once built for production, deploy the contents of the `dist/` directory.
