            <p>Nuru is a Congolese company focused on connectivity throughout eastern Congo. We built our first solar-based energy site in Beni, and are now constructing a 1.3MW hybrid site in Goma, which will be one of the largest off-grid solar projects in all of sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
            <p>Nuru was first established under the name Kivu Green Energy in August 2015, when we acquired the largest commercial energy provider in Beni, North Kivu. The following year, we oversaw a 35kW solar installation at a university in Beni, and in June 2017 installed our first commercial solar PV and storage system. It was the first of its kind in eastern Congo and provides affordable and reliable electricity to over 60 households, small- or medium-sized enterprises, and NGOs. It is a 55kW solar-based mini-grid in the Boikene neighborhood of Beni with a 100kVa back-up genset.</p>
