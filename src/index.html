                <p>Nuru (Swahili for "light") is a Congolese company dedicated to enhancing connectivity in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Nuru deployed Congo's first solar-based energy mini-grid in 2017 and is currently constructing a 1.3MW solar hybrid site in Goma, the largest off-grid mini-grid in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
                <p>Nuru was first established under the name Kivu Green Energy in August 2015. We changed our name in September 2019 to reflect our expansion beyond the Kivu regions into other parts of DRC.</p>
